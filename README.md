# BMI Calculator

This BMI Calculator is a simple, interactive web application built using React. As someone currently learning React, I chose to create this project as a fun and practical alternative to the traditional to-do list applications that are commonly used for learning new programming concepts.

## Overview

The BMI Calculator allows users to input their weight and height and calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI). It's designed with simplicity in mind, utilising React components and state management to provide a responsive and intuitive user experience.

## Features

- **User Input**: Accepts weight in kilograms and height in centimeters.
- **BMI Calculation**: Calculates the BMI based on the provided inputs and displays the result.
- **Result Interpretation**: Provides a categorisation of the BMI result, such as Normal, Underweight, Overweight, etc., along with a corresponding color indication for quick understanding.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap for a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.

## Learning Journey

Creating this BMI Calculator has been an exciting journey into the world of React. It has allowed me to explore key concepts such as components, state management, and event handling in a hands-on manner. I have taken this project futher in a private repo to serve it via Django whilst using Vite for React. You can check it out here: https://bmi.jamesf.xyz

## How to Use

To use the BMI Calculator, simply clone this repository, navigate to the project directory, and open `index.html` in your web browser. Enter your weight and height in the respective fields and click "Calculate" to see your BMI.

## Future Enhancements

While this project currently serves as a basic BMI Calculator, future enhancements could include more detailed health advice, integration with fitness tracking APIs, and the implementation of more advanced React features.

## Feedback

As I'm on a journey of continuous learning, I welcome any feedback or suggestions on how to improve this project or on React development in general.
